# DevPSU Assignment 2 Submission

This is my submission for DevPSU's learn ReactJS activity. It was my first time devloping in React. I was not able to meet some of the requirements of the submission, such as making use of npm-axios and the react function componentDidMount(). Instead, I used the ways I learned how to make API calls in the YouTube tutorial that I watched, such as using fetch() and onEffect(). In the end, the output is the same.
